# Dependancy

Tests need "unifield_tests" module from this branch: lp:~odossmann/unifield-wm/ref_wm_tests

# Use it!

To use PyUnit tests in this directory:

    python test_runner.py

# What does the script?

  * Read the 'tests' directory
  * For each file that begins by "test_" and ends with ".py" read the get_test_class() method that return the class to use
  * Create a Test Suite with all given class
  * Run all tests and create an "output.html" file that contains the result

# Notes

  * Tests should inherit from UnifieldTest or for another Class that inherits from UnifieldTest
  * UnifieldTest class checks that "unifield_tests" module is loaded in order to check that some data are loaded
