Need to increment:

- analytic distribution. Example: analytic_distribution/1, analytic_distribution/2, analytic_distribution/3, ...

- purchase order name. Example: 'name': u'PO00001', 'name': u'PO00002', 'name': u'PO00003', ...

- #uuid#/purchase_order/2_1, #uuid#/purchase_order/2_2, #uuid#/purchase_order/2_3, ...

In this example, 4cbde70ec44411e1a45908002785f830 is the uuid of the HQ where the analytic account and product were created. The value does not matter.

The "send message" (3.xml) has not been normalized. Waiting for work to be done on this part.

1.xml and 2.xml push data. The key is the group. All the instances from that group will pull the data.
3.ml pushes a message which contains the PO supplier (here COORDO). The COORDO will pull a message which will create a FO (TS_06)
