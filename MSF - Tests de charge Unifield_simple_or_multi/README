The most important file is build.properties
The test plan is jmeter-test-fixedload.jmx while the instances creation is jmeter-test-setup.jmx

You need JMeter 2.7 which is not the one packaged in Ubuntu 10.04. However you do need the ant-contrib package.

The file jsch-0.1.48.jar located in the lib folder must be copied into /usr/share/ant/lib

The test source files are in the resources folder. To understand what each Test Scenario (TS) is, please refer to the "Load tests" document in the docs folder.

The main ant commands are:
- ant setup-env, restores remotely the database and creates the instances into the database.

- ant run-load-test, performs the tests enabled in the test plan.

Those commands must be typed in the same directory than build.xml.
If you want to run the load tests directly from the jmeter GUI. You must enter the jmeter path from the build.xml directory. Example: gbe@msf ~/MSF - Tests de charge Unifield_simple_ou_multi $ ~/apache-jmeter-2.7/bin/jmeter

As there are some variables with default values, you may want to change them directly in the test plan or from the commandline. Example: gbe@msf ~/MSF - Tests de charge Unifield_simple_ou_multi $ ~/apache-jmeter-2.7/bin/jmeter -Jhost=10.82.4.10 -Jport=50182 -Jmax.size=500

To generate the XML files go to: MSF - Tests de charge Unifield_simple_or_multi/docs/Second_campaign/Scenarii/Captures and execute the scripts. In the end, the xml files must be copied into MSF - Tests de charge Unifield_simple_or_multi/resources such as MSF - Tests de charge Unifield_simple_or_multi/resources/TS_1. The path matters.

If you want to use several machines for the load tests, you must define them in build.properties, put their IPs in /etc/hosts on the master node, transfer the folder resources to each injector and run jmeter-server

msf@injector1:~$ ls
apache-jmeter-2.7  resources
msf@injector1:~$ apache-jmeter-2.7/bin/jmeter-server

Extra care must be used with the rules id. You need to change the file to match your setup. A database from code pilot0.4 is provided in the resources.

That's it folks!
