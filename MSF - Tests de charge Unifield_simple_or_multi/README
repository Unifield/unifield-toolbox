The most important file is build.properties
The test plan is jmeter-test-fixedload.jmx while the instances creation is jmeter-test-setup.jmx

You need JMeter 2.7 which is not the one packaged in Ubuntu 10.04. However you do need the ant-contrib package.

The file jsch-0.1.48.jar located in the lib folder must be copied into /usr/share/ant/lib

The test source files are in the resources folder. To understand what each Test Scenario (TS) is, please refer to the "Load tests v7" document in the docs folder.

The main ant commands are:
- ant setup-env, it creates the instances into the database. It should be able to drop and create the database and send the database file over the network (you can test with the dsp4synchrc2 provided) but I could not dump properly the sp5 database just like the dsp4.

- ant run-load-test, performs the tests enabled in the test plan.

Those commands must be typed in the same directory than build.xml.
If you want to run the load tests directly from the jmeter GUI. You must enter the jmeter path from the build.xml directory. Example: gbe@msf ~/MSF - Tests de charge Unifield_simple_ou_multi $ ~/apache-jmeter-2.7/bin/jmeter

As there are some variables with default values, you may want to change them directly in the test plan or from the commandline. Example: gbe@msf ~/MSF - Tests de charge Unifield_simple_ou_multi $ ~/apache-jmeter-2.7/bin/jmeter -Jhost=10.82.4.10 -Jport=50182 -Jmax.size=500

If you want to use several machines for the load tests, you must define them in build.properties and on each injector run jmeter-server

Extra care must be used with the rules id. You need to change the file to match your setup.

On this version, every TS rule ID is from my dsp4synchrc2 version. I don't know if tests other than TS_1 and TS_2 work with a dsp5 code. The TS_1 rule id corresponding to product.product is the rule ID generated by Duy and Cecile's script for the dsp5-uf1198 codebase

That's it folks!
